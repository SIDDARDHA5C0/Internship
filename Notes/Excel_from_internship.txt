 4. +,-
 5. div

 if same precedence the associativity will be like left to right. 
 
 to perform the operations, enter = and select the cells and enter operator to write the expressions.
 
to Access range , use : operator 
eg:- =B2:B9
     =B2:F6
to access the columns and the rows
 eg:- 1:1 first row
	1:2 
 for columns 
 eg:- A:A first column
`
use shift+ctrl+down to select all the columns 
use ctrl+up to move to top of the excel sheet.

=MIN():- used to find the minimum value
=MAX():- used to find the maxixum value

if you want to fill the values with a column untill end, double click at bottom right of the cell.



References:-
 we use the $ operator for references

$A2:- referes the  specific  columns
A$2:-referes to the specific  rows
$A$2:- referes to specific cell.

TO find access the values from the other sheets
=sheet_number!operation
=average(sheet1!B2:B7)

to access data from other workbook (file should be in same directory otherwise the path will be copied in place of workbook)
=[workbook_name]sheet_number! operation

using if conditions

=IF(condition,true,false)

using and operation
AND(condition1, condition2,...,conditionN)
OR(condition1, condition2,...,conditionN)

using concatenation 
=CONCATENATION(cell,cell2,....,celln)

using sumif function
=sumif(range_or_cells,"condition")
eg:- =SUMIF(C2:E2,">80")


using count functions
=COUNT(RANGE) :- used to find the count of the elements in range
=COUNTA(RANGE):- used to find the count of non empty cells
=COUNTBLANK(RANGE):- used to find the no of blank cells
=COUNTIF(RANGE,"value"):- used to find the no of value count in range.


date and time functions
=TODAY():- used to give today date
=YEAR():- used to give year
=MONTH():-used to get month
=DAY():- used to get the day
=WEEKDAY():- used to get the weekday

=LOWER():- used to make the whole text into the lowercase
=PROPER():- used to make each stating letter capital
=TRIM():- used to trim the leading and trailing spaces.


VLOOKUP function
 =VLOOKUP(REFERENCE_CELL OR RANGE,WHAT TO CHECK RANGE,1,FALSE):- used to update the values based given input.
eg:- =VLOOKUP(C11,A2:E8,1,FALSE)


ERRORS
1. #NAME?
2. #DIV/0! :- division by 0
3. #REF!   :- reference error
4. #NULL!  :- null value error
5. ###### :- when space not sufficient to view
6. #VALUE! 
7. #NUM!    


Types of charts in excel:-
1. area
2. bar
3. column:- 
4. line
5. pie
6. radar
7. scatter
8. stock:
9. surface 



indentifing cells on conditional formatting:-( by using conditional formatting the values will get dynamically updated)
 select the columns and go for options.


 
creation of pivot tables:-

create your own pivot table
select the table> insert > pivot table

if you want to add an extra pivot table,
there are 2 ways
i.select table> insert> pivot table > exsiting table with cell selected . if cell not selected, destination reference error is found.
ii. just copy the already exsiting the paste it.

pivot table has 4 tabs at right bottom:
1. rows :- shows data on row side
2. column:- shows data on column side
3. values:- show which values should be displayed.
4. filter:- used to apply the filters.


creation of the dashboard:-

we can remove the gridline from view > uncheck gridline
insert the background with a picture:- click on pagelayout> background > select pictures.
create slicers by right clicking on the charts or select them from insert> slicer.
