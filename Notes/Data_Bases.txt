key concepts of sql
 1. tables 
2. queries
3. crud operations
4. data types
5. constrainstsk
6. indexes


data analysis with sql
1. filtering data
2. aggregating data
3. grouping data
4. joining tables
5. subqueries

difference b/w the excel and sql
excel 					sql
1. works with flat,tabular data     1. works with relational data stored in 
structures.					  multiple tables
2. wide range of data manupulation   2. limited but have some advanced data 
using pivot tables and formulas        manupulation like subqueries and table 
3. slower when with large datasets    joins
						  3. high performance with large dataset.

sql commands
1. data definition language:- drop,alter,create
2. data manupulation language:- delete,update,insert
3. data control language:- revoke,grant
4. data query language:- select


data types in sql 
1. numberic 
	a.) 
2. character
3. date


mysql is a not case-sensitive.

convertion of csv file into a data table in mysql:-
create a database >select created database in schemas > right click on the tables>
click "table data import wizard"> select the data file> change the datatypes if required and press next.

convertion of the result into a excel or csv file :- 
click export icon in the result grid > select location and save the file 

Renaming columns names:- 
1. we can use change or modify with alter table 
we can use rename column with alter table.

1. alter table table_name [MODIFY | Change] COLUMN old_column_name new_column_name data_type;

for multiple columns:-
ALTER TABLE table_name
 [MODIFY | Change] old_column_name1 new_column_name1 data_type1,
 [MODIFY | Change] old_column_name2 new_column_name2 data_type2,
 [MODIFY | Change] old_column_name3 new_column_name3 data_type3,
...

eg:-ALTER TABLE employees
MODIFY|change COLUMN salary_amount DECIMAL(10,2);

2. ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME COLUMN old_column_name TO new_column_name;

for multiple columns:-
ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME COLUMN old_column_name1 TO new_column_name1,
RENAME COLUMN old_column_name2 TO new_column_name2,
RENAME COLUMN old_column_name3 TO new_column_name3,
...

eg:-ALTER TABLE employees
RENAME COLUMN salary TO salary_amount;


Adding constraints like primary or foreign key:-
1. adding primary key:-
alter table table_name add constraint primary key(column_name);
2. adding forgein key:-
alter table table_name add constraint foreign key(column_name) references table_name_x(column_name)
Note:- the following error occurs when the data or record in table is not present in referencing table.->  Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`analysis`.`#sql-1660_d`, CONSTRAINT `data_1_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`id`) REFERENCES `data` (`id`))

joins:-
we can join 2 tables with different join keywords followed by on keyword with tell on which column the tables are joining.


case statements:-

CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN condition3 THEN result3
    ...
    ELSE default_result
END

eg:-
SELECT name, age,
    CASE
        WHEN age >= 18 THEN 'Adult'
        ELSE 'Minor'
    END AS age_group
FROM people;
:- the age_group column is not create it is just a result.

aggregating functions are:- 
1. count() :- used to count the rows
2. avg() :- used to get average.
3. sum():- used to get the sum.
4. max():- used to get the maximun.
5. min():- used to get the minimum.

sorting:-
query order by column [asc|desc].

we can use the edit beside the export icon to edit the results in the result window
